my current mix of skins for osu!

Credits, if I missed something please let me know, its a bad hodgepodge and I forgot sometimes that I share this.

(most skins only have elements in the "Extras" folder)

- Circles/spinner are my own but most other elements are taken from another skin. 
- Cursors labelled "V1 (color)" etc are my own work.
<br /> feel free to use any of my elements just leave a link here if you do please.

If I am using elements of your skin and you do not want me to, please message me and let me know.
